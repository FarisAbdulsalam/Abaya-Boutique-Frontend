### Here are some details about the implementation of my project


**1. Database Design (ERD)**

This ERD shows the main tables in the project and how they are related to each other  
It shows the main entities such as **Abaya**, **User**, and **Custom**, along with their relationships and key attributes.

You can view the detailed ERD image below or click [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/53779120-5de1-41f2-bb80-0602a8f42976/edit?viewport_loc=-1013%2C-115%2C1505%2C811%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_0dd27076-da55-46ac-bed3-4ef75466cb15) to see the full diagram online.

**2 . 📋 Project Planning with Trello**

At the srart of the project, i created a task plan using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hMG32qiy/abaya-project) , which helped us save time and stay organized.
Trello allowed us to clearly arrange and manage tasks visually, making the development process more efficient — as shown in the image below

**3. 🎨 Initial Design with Figma**

After planning, we created a basic design for the project using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/3mm4P1kGuKzHKULug1eDOz/Abaya-Boutiqe?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=QyfiFFGWSt4DS2WK-0) .
This step helped us visualize the layout and understand how we wanted the structure and interface of our project to look , as shown in the image below
